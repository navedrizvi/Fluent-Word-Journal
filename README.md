# Fluent Word Journal

iOS application to learn new words and build vocabulary

### Motivation

Needed to consolidate an ever growing list of words. Was too lazy to find meanings for each individual word, so this idea came up. Regular notifications and quizzes help prioritize learning new words.

### Prerequisites

Xcode 11

### Installing

Pod dependencies:

```
pod install
```

## Built With

- [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui) for developing a cross-platform UI
- [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) for event-processing
- [Workdnik API](https://developer.wordnik.com) for word details
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for user persistence
